Description: Measure of the Effect ('MOTE') is an effect size calculator, including a 
    wide variety of effect sizes in the mean differences family (all versions of d) and 
    the variance overlap family (eta, omega, epsilon, r). 'MOTE' provides non-central 
    confidence intervals for each effect size, relevant test statistics, and output 
    for reporting in APA Style (American Psychological Association, 2010, 
    <ISBN:1433805618>) with 'LaTeX'. In research, an over-reliance on p-values 
    may conceal the fact that a study is under-powered (Halsey, Curran-Everett, 
    Vowler, & Drummond, 2015 <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3288>). A test may be statistically 
    significant, yet practically inconsequential (Fritz, Scherndl, & KÃ¼hberger, 2012 
    <doi:10.1177/0959354312436870>). Although the American Psychological Association 
    has long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes (Wilkinson & American 
    Psychological Association Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999 
    <doi:10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594>), the vast majority of peer-reviewed, 
    published academic studies stop short of reporting effect sizes and confidence 
    intervals (Cumming, 2013, <doi:10.1177/0956797613504966>). 'MOTE' simplifies 
    the use and interpretation of effect sizes and confidence intervals. For more
