\description{
This function displays \eqn{d_g} (Hedges' g) corrected
and the non-central confidence interval for independent \eqn{t}.
}
\details{
The small-sample correction factor is:

\deqn{\mathrm{correction} = 1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2) - 9}}

\eqn{d_g} is computed as the standardized mean difference multiplied by the correction:

\deqn{d_g = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{s_{\mathrm{pooled}}} \times \mathrm{correction}}

# The following example is derived from the "indt_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
# being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
# can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
# watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
# each participant was questioned about what he or she had
# seen. The four participants in the experimental group
# were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
# participants in the control group received the same
# questioning without hypnosis.

   t.test(correctq ~ group, data = indt_data)

# You can type in the numbers directly, or refer to the dataset,
# as shown below.

    g.ind.t(m1 = 17.75, m2 = 23, sd1 = 3.30,
           sd2 = 2.16, n1 = 4, n2 = 4, a = .05)

    g.ind.t(17.75, 23, 3.30, 2.16, 4, 4, .05)

    g.ind.t(mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            .05)

# Contrary to the hypothesized result, the group that underwent hypnosis were
# significantly less accurate while reporting facts than the control group
# with a large effect size, t(6) = -2.66, p = .038, d_g = 1.64.
