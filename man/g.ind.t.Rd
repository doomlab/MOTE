\description{
This function displays d-g corrected
and the non-central confidence interval for independent t.
}
\details{
The correction is calculated by dividing three by the sum of both
sample sizes after multiplying by four and subtracting nine.
This amount is deducted from one.

     correction = 1 - (3 / (4 * (n1 + n2) - 9))

D-g corrected is calculated by substracting mean two from mean one,
dividing by the pooled standard deviation which is multiplied
by the correction above.

     d_g corrected = ((m1 - m2) / spooled) * correction

# The following example is derived from the "indt_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
# being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
# can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
# watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
# each participant was questioned about what he or she had
# seen. The four participants in the experimental group
# were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
# participants in the control group received the same
# questioning without hypnosis.

   t.test(correctq ~ group, data = indt_data)

# You can type in the numbers directly, or refer to the dataset,
# as shown below.

    g.ind.t(m1 = 17.75, m2 = 23, sd1 = 3.30,
           sd2 = 2.16, n1 = 4, n2 = 4, a = .05)

    g.ind.t(17.75, 23, 3.30, 2.16, 4, 4, .05)

    g.ind.t(mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            .05)

# Contrary to the hypothesized result, the group that underwent hypnosis were
# significantly less accurate while reporting facts than the control group
# with a large effect size, t(6) = -2.66, p = .038, d_g = 1.64.
