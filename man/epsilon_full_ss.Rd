\item{dfm}{degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between}

\item{dfe}{degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within}

\value{
Provides the effect size (\eqn{\epsilon^2}) with associated
confidence intervals from the \eqn{F}-statistic.

\description{
**Note on function and output names:** This effect size is now implemented
with the snake_case function name `epsilon_full_ss()` to follow modern R
style guidelines. The original dotted version `epsilon.full.SS()` is still
available as a wrapper for backward compatibility, and both functions
return the same list. The returned object includes both the original
element names (e.g., `epsilon`, `epsilonlow`, `epsilonhigh`, `dfm`, `dfe`,
`F`, `p`, `estimate`, `statistic`) and newer snake_case aliases (e.g.,
`epsilon_value`, `epsilon_lower_limit`, `epsilon_upper_limit`,
`df_model`, `df_error`, `f_value`, `p_value`). New code should prefer
`epsilon_full_ss()` and the snake_case output names, but existing code
using the older names will continue to work.

\details{
This function displays \eqn{\epsilon^2} from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the \eqn{F} distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
focus on the sum of squares total calculation.

To calculate \eqn{\epsilon^2}, first, the mean square for the error is
substracted from the mean square for the model. The difference
is multiplied by the degrees of freedom for the model. The
product is divided by the sum of squares total.

\deqn{\epsilon^2 = \frac{df_m (ms_m - ms_e)}{SS_T}}

# The following example is derived from the "bn1_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
