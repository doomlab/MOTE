\item{vhigh}{upper level confidence interval of V}
\item{n}{sample size}
\item{df}{degrees of freedom}
\item{x2}{significance statistic}

\description{
This function displays V and non-central confidence interval
for the specified chi-square statistic.
}
\details{
V is calculated by finding the square root of chi-squared divided by the product
of the sample size and the degrees of freedom with the lowest value.

     v = sqrt(x2 / (n * dfsmall))

# The following example is derived from the "chisq_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# Individuals were polled about their number of friends (low, medium, high)
# and their number of kids (1, 2, 3+) to determine if there was a
# relationship between friend groups and number of children, as we
# might expect that those with more children may have less time for
# friendship maintaining activities.

chisq.test(chisq_data$kids, chisq_data$friends)

v.chi.sq(x2 = 2.0496, n = 60, r = 3, c = 3, a = .05)

# Please note, if you see a warning, that implies the lower effect should
# be zero, as noted.
