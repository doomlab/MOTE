\description{
This function displays d-delta for between subjects data
and the non-central confidence interval using the
control group standard deviation as the denominator.
}
\details{
To calculate d-delta, the mean of the experimental group
is subtracted from the mean of the control group, which
is divided by the standard deviation of the control group.

     d_delta = (m1 - m2) / sd1

#The following example is derived from the "indt_data" dataset, included
#in the MOTE library.

#A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#participants in the control group received the same
#questioning without hypnosis.

    hyp = t.test(correctq ~ group, data = indt_data)

#You can type in the numbers directly, or refer to the dataset,
#as shown below.

    delta.ind.t(m1 = 17.75, m2 = 23,
               sd1 = 3.30, sd2 = 2.16,
                n1 = 4, n2 = 4, a = .05)

    delta.ind.t(17.75, 23, 3.30, 2.16, 4, 4, .05)

    delta.ind.t(mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            .05)

#Contrary to the hypothesized result, the group that underwent hypnosis were
#significantly less accurate while reporting facts than the control group
#with a large effect size, t(6) = -2.66, p = .038, d_delta = 1.59.
