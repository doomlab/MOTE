\description{
This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
focus on which error term you are using for the calculation.
}
\details{
Omega squared is calculated by deducting the mean square of the error
from the mean square of the model and multiplying by the degrees of freedom for the model.
This is divided by the sum of the sum of squares total and the mean square of the error.

     omega = (dfm * (msm - mse)) / (sst + mse)

# The following example is derived from the "bn1_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
