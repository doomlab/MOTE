\description{
This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
These values are calculated directly from F statistics and can be used
for between subjects and repeated measures designs.
Remember if you have two or more IVs, these values are partial omega squared.
}
\details{
Omega squared or partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting one
from the F-statistic and multiplying it by degrees of freedom of the model. This is
divided by the same value after adding the number of valid responses. This
value will be omega squared for one-way ANOVA designs, and will be
partial omega squared for multi-way ANOVA designs (i.e. with more than one IV).

     omega^2 = (dfm * (Fvalue-1)) / ((dfm * (Fvalue-1)) + n)

# The following example is derived from
# the "bn1_data" dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
