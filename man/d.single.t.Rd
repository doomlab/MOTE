\description{
This function displays d and non-central confidence interval for single t from means.
}
\details{
To calculate d, the population is subtracted from the sample mean,
which is then divided by the standard deviation.

     d = (m - u) / sd

# The following example is derived from the "singt_data"
# dataset included in the MOTE library.

# A school has a gifted/honors program that they claim is
# significantly better than others in the country. The gifted/honors
# students in this school scored an average of 1370 on the SAT,
# with a standard deviation of 112.7, while the national average
# for gifted programs is a SAT score of 1080.

    gift <- t.test(singt_data, mu = 1080, alternative = "two.sided")

# You can type in the numbers directly as shown below,
# or refer to your dataset within the function.

    d.single.t(m = 1370, u = 1080, sd = 112.7, n = 14, a = .05)

    d.single.t(1370, 1080, 112.7, 100, .05)

    d.single.t(gift$estimate, gift$null.value,
               sd(singt_data$SATscore),
               length(singt_data$SATscore), .05)
