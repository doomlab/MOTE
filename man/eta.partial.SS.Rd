\description{
This function displays partial eta squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs.
}
\details{
Partial eta squared is calculated by dividing the sum of squares
of the model by the sum of the sum of squares of the model and
sum of squares of the error.

     partial eta^2 = ssm / (ssm + sse)

# The following example is derived from the "bn2_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# Is there a difference in athletic spending budget for different sports?
# Does that spending interact with the change in coaching staff? This data includes
# (fake) athletic budgets for baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and volleyball teams
# with new and old coaches to determine if there are differences in
# spending across coaches and sports.
