\description{
This function displays odds ratios and their normal confidence intervals.
This statistic is calculated as (level 1.1/level 1.2) /
(level 2.1/level 2.2), which can be considered the odds of
level 1.1 given level1 overall versus level2.1 given level2 overall.
}
\details{
**Note on function and output names:** This effect size is now implemented
with the snake_case function name `odds_ratio()` to follow modern R style
guidelines. The original name `odds()` is still available as a wrapper for
backward compatibility, and both functions return the same list. The returned
object includes both the original element names (e.g., `odds`, `olow`,
`ohigh`, `se`) and newer snake_case aliases (e.g., `odds_value`,
`odds_lower_limit`, `odds_upper_limit`, `standard_error`). New code should
prefer `odds_ratio()` and the snake_case output names, but existing code
using the older names will continue to work.

# A health psychologist was interested in the rates of anxiety in
# first generation and regular college students. They polled campus
# and found the following data:

  # |              | First Generation | Regular |
  # |--------------|------------------|---------|
  # | Low Anxiety  | 10               | 50      |
  # | High Anxiety | 20               | 15      |

# What are the odds for the first generation students to have anxiety?

odds_ratio(n11 = 10, n12 = 50, n21 = 20, n22 = 15, a = .05)

# Backwards-compatible wrapper (deprecated name)
odds(n11 = 10, n12 = 50, n21 = 20, n22 = 15, a = .05)
