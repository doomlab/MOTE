\description{
This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula is appropriate for multi-way between subjects designs.
}
\details{
Partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting the mean square for the error
from the mean square of the model, which is multiplied by degrees of freedom of
the model. This is divided by the product of the degrees of freedom
for the model are deducted from the sample size, multiplied by the
mean square of the error, plus the sum of squares for the model.

     omega^2 <- (dfm * (msm - mse)) / (ssm + (n-dfm)*mse)

# The following example is derived from the "bn2_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# Is there a difference in athletic spending budget for different sports?
# Does that spending interact with the change in coaching staff? This data includes
# (fake) athletic budgets for baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and volleyball teams
# with new and old coaches to determine if there are differences in
# spending across coaches and sports.
