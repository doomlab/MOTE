\arguments{
\item{t}{t-test value}

\item{n}{sample size}

\item{a}{significance level}
}
\value{
The effect size (Cohen's d) with associated confidence intervals
and relevant statistics.

\item{dlow}{lower level confidence interval d value}
\item{dhigh}{upper level confidence interval d value}
\item{n}{sample size}
\item{df}{degrees of freedom (sample size - 1)}

\item{p}{p-value}

}
\description{
This function displays d and non-central confidence interval for single t
estimated from the t-statistic.
}
\details{
To calculate d, the t-statistic is divided by the square root of the sample size.

     d = t / sqrt(n)

#A school has a gifted/honors program that they claim is
#significantly better than others in the country. The gifted/honors
#students in this school scored an average of 1370 on the SAT,
#with a standard deviation of 112.7, while the national average
#for gifted programs is a SAT score of 1080.

    gift = t.test(singt_data, mu = 1080, alternative = "two.sided")

#According to a single-sample t-test, the scores of the students
#from the program were significantly higher than the national
#average, t(14) = 9.97, p < .001.

#You can type in the numbers directly as shown below, or refer
#to your dataset within the function.
