\description{
This function displays odds ratios and their normal confidence intervals.
}
\details{
This statistic is the ratio between level 1.1 divided by level 1.2, and
level 2.1 divided by 2.2. In other words, these are the odds of level 1.1
given level 1 overall versus level 2.1 given level 2 overall.

To calculate odds ratios, First, the sample size for level 1.1
is divided by the sample size for level 1.2. This value is divided
by the sample size for level 2.1, after dividing by the sample
size of level 2.2.

     odds <- (n11 / n12) / (n21 / n22)

#A health psychologist was interested in the rates of anxiety in
#first generation and regular college students. They polled campus
#and found the following data:

  #|              | First Generation | Regular |
  #|--------------|------------------|---------|
  #| Low Anxiety  | 10               | 50      |
  #| High Anxiety | 20               | 15      |

#What are the odds for the first generation students to have anxiety?

odds(n11 = 10, n12 = 50, n21 = 20, n22 = 15, a = .05)
