\description{
This function displays partial ges squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for multi-way repeated measures designs.
}
\details{
To calculate partial generalized eta squared, first, the sum of
squares of the model, sum of squares of the subject
variance, sum of squares for the first and second independent variables,
and the sum of squares for the interaction are added together.
The sum of squares of the model is divided by this value.

     partial ges <- ssm / (ssm + sss + sse1 + sse2 + sse3)

#The following example is derived from the "rm2_data" dataset, included
#in the MOTE library.

#In this experiment people were given word pairs to rate based on
#their "relatedness". How many people out of a 100 would put LOST-FOUND
#together? Participants were given pairs of words and asked to rate them
#on how often they thought 100 people would give the second word if shown
#the first word.  The strength of the word pairs was manipulated through
#the actual rating (forward strength: FSG) and the strength of the reverse
#rating (backward strength: BSG). Is there an interaction between FSG and
#BSG when participants are estimating the relation between word pairs?
