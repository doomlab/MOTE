\description{
Dataset for use in \code{\link{v.chi.sq}},
Individuals were polled and asked to report their number of friends
(low, medium, high) and number of kids (1, 2, 3+)
to determine if there was a relationship between friend
groups and number of children. It was hypothesized that
those with more children may have less time for
friendship maintaining activities.
