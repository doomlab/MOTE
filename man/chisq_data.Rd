\description{
Example data for a chi-square test of independence. Individuals were
polled and asked to report their number of friends (low, medium, high)
and their number of children (1, 2, 3 or more). The analysis examines
whether there is an association between friend group size and number of
children. It was hypothesized that those with more children may have
less time for friendship-maintaining activities.
