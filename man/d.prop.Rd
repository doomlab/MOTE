\description{
This function displays d and central confidence interval
calculated from differences in independent proportions.
Independent proportions are two percentages that are from
different groups of participants.
}
\details{
To calculate z, the proportion of group two is substracted
from group one, which is then divided by the standard error.

     z = (p1 - p2) / se

To calculate d, the proportion of group two is divided by
the standard error of group two which is then subtracted
from the proportion of group one divided by the standard
error of group one.

    z1 = p1 / se1

    z2 = p2 / se2

     d = z1 - z2

# Several researchers were examining the data on the number
# of students who retake a course after they receive a D, F,
# or withdraw from the course. They randomly sampled form
# a large university two groups of students: traditional
# (less than 25 years old) and non-traditional (25 and older).
# Each group included 100 participants. About 25\% of students
# of the traditional group reported they would retake a course,
# while the non-traditional group showed about 35\% would
# retake the course.

# You can type in the numbers directly as shown below,
# or refer to your dataset within the function.
