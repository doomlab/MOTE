\description{
Compute Cohen's \eqn{d_{prop}} for independent proportions and a central confidence interval.
Independent proportions are two percentages from different groups of participants.
}
\details{
The z-statistic is:
\deqn{z = \frac{p_1 - p_2}{SE_{pooled}}}
where the pooled standard error is based on the pooled proportion:
\deqn{SE_{pooled} = \sqrt{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p}) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) }}
and \eqn{\hat{p} = \frac{p_1 n_1 + p_2 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}}.

For each group, the z-statistic is computed as:
\deqn{z_1 = \frac{p_1}{SE_1}, \quad SE_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{p_1 (1 - p_1)}{n_1} }}
\deqn{z_2 = \frac{p_2}{SE_2}, \quad SE_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{p_2 (1 - p_2)}{n_2} }}

Cohen's \eqn{d_{prop}} is then:
\deqn{d_{prop} = z_1 - z_2}

# Several researchers were examining the data on the number
# of students who retake a course after they receive a D, F,
# or withdraw from the course. They randomly sampled from
# a large university two groups of students: traditional
# (less than 25 years old) and non-traditional (25 and older).
# Each group included 100 participants. About 25\% of students
# of the traditional group reported they would retake a course,
# while the non-traditional group showed about 35\% would
# retake the course.

# You can type in the numbers directly as shown below,
# or refer to your dataset within the function.
