\value{
Provides the effect size (correlation coefficient) with associated
confidence intervals, the t-statistic, F-statistic, and other estimates
appropriate for d to r translation. Note this CI is not based on the
traditional r-to-z transformation but rather non-central F using the
ci.R function from MBESS.

\description{
Calculates r from d and then translates r to r2 to calculate
the non-central confidence interval for r2 using the F distribution.
}
\details{
The correlation coefficient (r) is calculated by dividing Cohen's d
by the square root of the total sample size squared - divided
by the product of the sample sizes of group one and group two.

     r = d / sqrt(d^2 + (n1 + n2)^2 / (n1*n2))

# The following example is derived from the "indt_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
# being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
# can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
# watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
# each participant was questioned about what he or she had
# seen. The four participants in the experimental group
# were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
# participants in the control group received the same
# questioning without hypnosis.

    t.test(correctq ~ group, data = indt_data)

# You can type in the numbers directly, or refer to the dataset,
# as shown below.

    d.ind.t(m1 = 17.75, m2 = 23, sd1 = 3.30,
           sd2 = 2.16, n1 = 4, n2 = 4, a = .05)

    d.ind.t(17.75, 23, 3.30, 2.16, 4, 4, .05)

    d.ind.t(mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            mean(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            sd(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 1]),
            length(indt_data$correctq[indt_data$group == 2]),
            .05)

# Contrary to the hypothesized result, the group that underwent
# hypnosis were significantly less accurate while reporting
# facts than the control group with a large effect size, t(6) = -2.66,
# p = .038, d_s = 1.88.

     d.to.r(d = -1.88, n1 = 4, n2 = 4, a = .05)
