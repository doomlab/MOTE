\description{
This function displays generalized omega squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula is appropriate for multi-way repeated measures
designs and mix level designs.
}
\details{
Omega squared is calculated by subtracting the product of the
degrees of freedom of the model and the mean square of the
subject variance from the sum of squares for the model.

This is divided by the value obtained after combining
the sum of squares total, sum of squares for the other
independent variable, and the mean square of the
subject variance multiplied by the number of levels
in the other model/IV/between.

     generalized omega^2 = (ssm - (dfm * mss)) / (sst + ssm2 + j*mss)

# The following example is derived from the "mix2_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# Given previous research, we know that backward strength in free
# association tends to increase the ratings participants give when
# you ask them how many people out of 100 would say a word in
# response to a target word (like Family Feud). This result is
# tied to peopleâ€™s overestimation of how well they think they know
# something, which is bad for studying. So, we gave people instructions
# on how to ignore the BSG.  Did it help? Is there an interaction
# between BSG and instructions given?
