\description{
**Note on function and output names:** This effect size is now implemented
with the snake_case function name `eta_f()` to follow modern R style
guidelines. The original dotted version `eta.F()` is still available as a
wrapper for backward compatibility, and both functions return the same
list. The returned object includes both the original element names
(e.g., `eta`, `etalow`, `etahigh`, `dfm`, `dfe`, `F`, `p`, `estimate`,
`statistic`) and newer snake_case aliases (e.g., `eta_value`,
`eta_lower_limit`, `eta_upper_limit`, `df_model`, `df_error`, `f_value`,
`p_value`). New code should prefer `eta_f()` and the snake_case output
names, but existing code using the older names will continue to work.

\details{
This function displays \eqn{\eta^2} from ANOVA analyses
and their non-central confidence interval based on the \eqn{F} distribution.
These values are calculated directly from F statistics and can be used
for between subjects and repeated measures designs.
Remember if you have two or more IVs, these values are partial eta squared.

Eta is calculated by multiplying the degrees of freedom of
the model by the F-statistic. This is divided by the product
of degrees of freedom of the model, the F-statistic, and
the degrees of freedom for the error or residual.

\deqn{\eta^2 = \frac{df_m \cdot F}{df_m \cdot F + df_e}}

# The following example is derived from the "bn1_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

anova_model <- lm(formula = friends ~ group, data = bn1_data)
summary.aov(anova_model)

eta_f(dfm = 2, dfe = 8,
      Fvalue = 5.134, a = .05)

# Backwards-compatible dotted name (deprecated)
eta.F(dfm = 2, dfe = 8,
      Fvalue = 5.134, a = .05)
