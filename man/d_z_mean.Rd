\description{
Computes Cohen's d for a Z-test using the sample mean,
population mean, and population standard deviation.
The function also provides a normal-theory confidence
interval for d, and returns relevant statistics including the
z-statistic and its p-value.
}
\details{
The effect size is computed as:
\deqn{d = \frac{m_1 - \mu}{\sigma}}
where \eqn{m_1} is the sample mean, \eqn{\mu} is the population mean,
and \eqn{\sigma} is the population standard deviation.

The z-statistic is:
\deqn{z = \frac{m_1 - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}}
where \eqn{n} is the sample size.
