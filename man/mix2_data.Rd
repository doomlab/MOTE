\format{
A data frame including group type and backward strength rating.

group: Regular JAM Task or Debiasing JAM task
bsglo: estimate of response to target word in a Low BSG condition
bsghi: estimate of response to target word in a High BSG condition

\description{
Dataset for use in \code{\link{ges.partial.SS.mix}}.
Given previous research, we know that backward strength
in free association tends to increase the ratings
participants give when you ask them how many people
out of 100 would say a word in response to a target
word (like Family Feud). This result is tied to
people's overestimation of how well they think they
know something, which is bad for studying. So, we
gave people instructions on how to ignore the BSG.
Did it help? Is there an interaction between BSG
and instructions given?
