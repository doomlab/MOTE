\title{Mixed Two-Way ANOVA Example Data}
\format{
A data frame with 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{group}{Factor indicating instruction condition with levels
    \code{"Regular JAM Task"} and \code{"Debiasing JAM task"}.}
  \item{bsglo}{Numeric. Estimated response percentage in the Low BSG condition.}
  \item{bsghi}{Numeric. Estimated response percentage in the High BSG condition.}
}
}
\usage{
data(mix2_data)
}
\description{
Example data for a mixed two-way ANOVA examining whether instructions to
ignore backward strength in free association (BSG) reduce overestimation in
response probabilities. Participants provided estimates of how many out of
100 people would say a given response to a target word ("Family Feud"-style),
under low vs. high BSG conditions, after receiving either regular or
debiasing instructions.
