\description{
This function displays partial generalized eta-squared (GES) from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for mixed designs.
}
\details{
To calculate partial generalized eta squared, first, the sum of
squares of the model, sum of squares of the subject
variance, sum of squares for the subject variance,
and the sum of squares for the error/residual/within are added together.
The sum of squares of the model is divided by this value.

     partial ges = ssm / (ssm + sss + sse)

# The following example is derived from the
# "mix2_data" dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# Given previous research, we know that backward strength in free
# association tends to increase the ratings participants give when
# you ask them how many people out of 100 would say a word in
# response to a target word (like Family Feud). This result is
# tied to peopleâ€™s overestimation of how well they think they know
# something, which is bad for studying. So, we gave people instructions
# on how to ignore the BSG.  Did it help? Is there an interaction
# between BSG and instructions given?
