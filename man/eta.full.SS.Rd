\description{
This function displays eta squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
focus on the sum of squares total.
}
\details{
Eta squared is calculated by dividing the sum of squares for the model
by the sum of squares total.

     eta^2 = ssm / sst

# The following example is derived from the "bn1_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

anova_model <- lm(formula = friends ~ group, data = bn1_data)
