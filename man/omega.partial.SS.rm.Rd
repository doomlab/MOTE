\description{
This function displays \eqn{\omega^2_p} from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the \eqn{F} distribution.
This formula is appropriate for multi-way repeated measures designs and mixed-level designs.
}
\details{
Partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting the mean
square for the error from the mean square of the model, which is
multiplied by degrees of freedom of the model. This is divided
by the sum of the sum of squares for the model, sum of squares
for the error, sum of squares for the subject, and the
mean square of the subject.

\deqn{\omega^2_p = \frac{df_m (MS_M - MS_E)}{SS_M + SS_E + SS_S + MS_S}}

The F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square
of the model by the mean square of the error.

     F = msm / mse

# The following example is derived from the "rm2_data" dataset,
# included in the MOTE library.

# In this experiment people were given word pairs to rate based on
# their "relatedness". How many people out of a 100 would put LOST-FOUND
# together? Participants were given pairs of words and asked to rate them
# on how often they thought 100 people would give the second word if shown
# the first word.  The strength of the word pairs was manipulated through
# the actual rating (forward strength: FSG) and the strength of the reverse
# rating (backward strength: BSG). Is there an interaction between FSG and
# BSG when participants are estimating the relation between word pairs?
