\usage{
d.z.z(z, sig = NA, n, a = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{z-statistic from a Z-test.}

\item{sig}{Population standard deviation (\eqn{\sigma}).}

\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{a}{Significance level (alpha) for the confidence interval. Must be in (0, 1).}

\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{d}{Effect size.}
  \item{dlow}{Lower confidence interval bound for \eqn{d}.}
  \item{dhigh}{Upper confidence interval bound for \eqn{d}.}
  \item{sigma}{Population standard deviation (\eqn{\sigma}).}
  \item{z}{z-statistic.}
  \item{p}{Two-tailed p-value.}
  \item{n}{Sample size.}
  \item{estimate}{The \eqn{d} statistic and confidence interval in APA style for markdown printing.}
  \item{statistic}{The Z-statistic in APA style for markdown printing.}
}
}
\description{
Compute Cohen's \eqn{d} from a z-statistic for a Z-test. If the population
standard deviation (\eqn{\sigma}) is provided, a normal-theory confidence interval
for \eqn{d} is also returned. If \eqn{\sigma} is omitted, confidence intervals are not computed.
}
\details{
The effect size is computed as:
\deqn{d = \frac{z}{\sqrt{n}},}
where \eqn{n} is the sample size.

The confidence interval bounds are:
\deqn{d_{\mathrm{low}} = d - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sigma}
\deqn{d_{\mathrm{high}} = d + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sigma}
where \eqn{z_{\alpha/2}} is the critical value from the standard normal distribution.

# A recent study suggested that students (N = 100) learning
# statistics improved their test scores with the use of
# visual aids (Z = 2.5). The population standard deviation is 4.

# You can type in the numbers directly as shown below,
# or refer to your dataset within the function.

    d.z.z(z = 2.5, sig = 4, n = 100, a = .05)

    d.z.z(z = 2.5, n = 100, a = .05)

    d.z.z(2.5, 4, 100, .05)
