\description{
This function displays epsilon squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
focus on the sum of squares total calculation.
}
\details{
To calculate epsilon, first, the mean square for the error is
substracted from the mean square for the model. The difference
is multiplied by the degrees of freedom for the model. The
product is divided by the sum of squares total.

     epsilon^2 = (dfm * (msm - mse)) / (sst)

# The following example is derived from the "bn1_data"
# dataset, included in the MOTE library.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
