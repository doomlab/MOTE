\description{
This function displays \eqn{\omega^2} from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the \eqn{F} distribution.
This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
focus on which error term you are using for the calculation.
}
\details{
Omega squared is calculated by deducting the mean square of the error
from the mean square of the model and multiplying by the degrees
of freedom for the model. This is divided by the sum of the sum of
squares total and the mean square of the error.

\deqn{\omega^2 = \frac{df_m (ms_m - ms_e)}{SS_T + ms_e}}

**Note on function and output names:** This effect size is now implemented
with the snake_case function name `omega_full_ss()` to follow modern R style
guidelines. The original dotted version `omega.full.SS()` is still available
as a wrapper for backward compatibility, and both functions return the same
list. The returned object includes both the original element names (e.g.,
`omega`, `omegalow`, `omegahigh`, `dfm`, `dfe`, `F`, `p`, `estimate`,
`statistic`) and newer snake_case aliases (e.g., `omega_value`,
`omega_lower_limit`, `omega_upper_limit`, `df_model`, `df_error`, `f_value`,
`p_value`). New code should prefer `omega_full_ss()` and the snake_case
output names, but existing code using the older names will continue to work.

# A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
# attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
# health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3
# close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5,
# and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
# had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
