\description{
Dataset for use in \code{\link{omega.F}}.
Participants were tested over several days to measure
variations in their pulse given different types of stimuli.
One stimulus was a neutral picture (like a toaster),
while other stimuli were cute/happy pictures (puppies, babies),
and negative stimuli (mutilated faces, pictures of war).
Were there differences in pulse for each participant
across the stimuli?
