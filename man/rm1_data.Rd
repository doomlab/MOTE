\title{Repeated Measures One-Way ANOVA Example Data}
\format{
A data frame with 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{neutral}{Numeric. Pulse rate during exposure to neutral stimuli.}
  \item{positive}{Numeric. Pulse rate during exposure to positive stimuli.}
  \item{negative}{Numeric. Pulse rate during exposure to negative stimuli.}
}
}
\usage{
data(rm1_data)
}
\description{
Example data for a repeated measures one-way ANOVA examining whether
pulse rate differs across stimulus types. Participants were exposed to
three categories of images: neutral (e.g., household objects like a toaster),
positive (e.g., puppies, babies), and negative (e.g., mutilated faces,
scenes of war). Pulse rate was measured for each participant under each condition.
