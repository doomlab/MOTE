We gladly take comments and updates! You can check out videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg), as well as watching or starring the github repo.

You can look at our how-to guide by going to: https://www.aggieerin.com/shiny-server/. This information is also present in the help files for each function, however, pictures are included on the website.   

You can now install `MOTE` directly from CRAN: `install.packages("MOTE")`.

To install the development version of the package take the following steps:

1) Install `devtools` if you do not have it. `devtools` is a package that allows you to install packages from github.
`install.packages("devtools")`

2) Install the `MOTE` package by running the following:
`devtools::install_github("doomlab/MOTE")`

3) Load the library to get started!
`library(MOTE)`

4) Enjoy MOTE. 

You can also use the [Shiny App](https://doomlab.shinyapps.io/mote/)!
