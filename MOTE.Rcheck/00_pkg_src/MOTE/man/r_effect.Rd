\description{
This function provides a unified interface for computing r- and
variance-based effect sizes (e.g., correlations and coefficients of
determination) from different input summaries. It is analogous to the
\code{d_effect()} wrapper for standardized mean difference effect sizes.
}
\details{
Currently, `r_effect()` supports effect sizes derived from Cohen's d,
from correlations, and from ANOVA summaries via several designs (see
**Supported designs**). These designs call lower-level functions
as [d_to_r()], [r_correl()], [epsilon_full_ss()], [eta_f()],
[omega_f()], [omega_full_ss()], [eta_full_ss()], [eta_partial_ss()],
[ges_partial_ss_mix()], [ges_partial_ss_rm()], [omega_partial_ss_rm()],
and [omega_g_ss_rm()] with the appropriate arguments.
