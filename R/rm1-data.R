#' @description
#' Example data for a repeated measures one-way ANOVA examining whether
#' pulse rate differs across stimulus types. Participants were exposed to
#' three categories of images: neutral (e.g., household objects like a toaster),
#' positive (e.g., puppies, babies), and negative (e.g., mutilated faces,
#' scenes of war). Pulse rate was measured for each participant under each condition.
#' Designed for use with \code{\link{omega.F}}.
