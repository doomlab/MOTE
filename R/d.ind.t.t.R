#' d from t for Between Subjects
#'
#' This function displays d for between subjects data
#' and the non-central confidence interval estimating from the t-statistic.
#'
#' To calculate d, the t-statistic is multiplied by two then divided by
#' the square root of the degrees of freedom.
#'
#'      d_s = 2 * t / sqrt(n1 + n2 - 2)

#' @param t t-test value
#' @param n1 sample size group one
#' @param n2 sample size group two
#' @param a significance level
#' @return Provides the effect size (Cohen's d) with associated confidence intervals,
#' degrees of freedom, t-statistic, and p-value.

#' #The following example is derived from the "indt_data" dataset, included
#' #in the MOTE library.
#'
#' #A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#' #being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#' #can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#' #watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#' #each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#' #seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#' #were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#' #participants in the control group recieved the same
#' #questioning without hypnosis.
#'
#'     hyp = t.test(correctq ~ group, data = indt_data)
#'
#' #You can type in the numbers directly, or refer to the dataset,
#' #as shown below.

#'               .05)
#'
#' #Contrary to the hypothesized result, the group that underwent hypnosis were
#' #significantly less accurate while reporting facts than the control group
#' #with a large effect size, t(6) = -2.66, p = .038, d_s = 2.17.
