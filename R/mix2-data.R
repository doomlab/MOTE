#' @description
#' Example data for a mixed two-way ANOVA examining whether instructions to
#' ignore backward strength in free association (BSG) reduce overestimation in
#' response probabilities. Participants provided estimates of how many out of
#' 100 people would say a given response to a target word ("Family Feud"-style),
#' under low vs. high BSG conditions, after receiving either regular or
#' debiasing instructions.
