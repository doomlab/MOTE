#' Omega Squared for One-Way and Multi-Way ANOVA from F
#'
#' This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
#' This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
#' focus on which error term you are using for the calculation.
#'
#' Omega squared is calculated by deducting the mean square of the error
#' from the mean square of the model and multiplying by the degrees of freedom for the model.
#' This is divided by the sum of the sum of squares total and the mean square of the error.
#'
#'      omega = (dfm * (msm - mse)) / (sst + mse)

#' # had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
