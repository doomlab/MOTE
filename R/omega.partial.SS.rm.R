#' Partial Omega Squared for Repeated Measures ANOVA from F
#'
#' This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
#' This formula is appropriate for multi-way repeated measures designs and mix level designs.
#'
#' Partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting the mean
#' square for the error from the mean square of the model, which is
#' multiplied by degrees of freedom of the model. This is divided
#' by the sum of the sum of squares for the model, sum of squares
#' for the error, sum of squares for the subject, and the
#' mean square of the subject.
#'
#'      omega_p^2 = (dfm x (msm - mse)) / (ssm + sse + sss + mss)
#'
#' The F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square
#' of the model by the mean square of the error.
#'
#'      F = msm / mse

#' # The following example is derived from the "rm2_data" dataset,
#' # included in the MOTE library.
#'
#' # In this experiment people were given word pairs to rate based on
#' # their "relatedness". How many people out of a 100 would put LOST-FOUND
#' # together? Participants were given pairs of words and asked to rate them
#' # on how often they thought 100 people would give the second word if shown
#' # the first word.  The strength of the word pairs was manipulated through
#' # the actual rating (forward strength: FSG) and the strength of the reverse
#' # rating (backward strength: BSG). Is there an interaction between FSG and
#' # BSG when participants are estimating the relation between word pairs?
