#' d-delta for Between Subjects with Control Group SD Denominator
#'
#' This function displays d-delta for between subjects data
#' and the non-central confidence interval using the
#' control group standard deviation as the denominator.
#'
#' To calculate d-delta, the mean of the experimental group
#' is subtracted from the mean of the control group, which
#' is divided by the standard deviation of the control group.
#'
#'      d_delta = (m1 - m2) / sd1

#' @param sd2 standard deviation from experimental group

#' @return Provides the effect size (Cohen's d) with associated confidence intervals,
#' the t-statistic, the confidence intervals associated with the means of each group, as well as the
#' standard deviations and standard errors of the means for each group.

#' # dataset, included in the MOTE library.
#'
#' # A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#' # being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#' # can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#' # watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#' # each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#' # seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#' # were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#' # participants in the control group received the same
#' # questioning without hypnosis.
