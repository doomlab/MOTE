#' Chi-Square Odds Ratios
#'
#' This function displays odds ratios and their normal confidence intervals.
#'
#' This statistic is the ratio between level 1.1 divided by level 1.2, and
#' level 2.1 divided by 2.2. In other words, these are the odds of level 1.1
#' given level 1 overall versus level 2.1 given level 2 overall.
#'
#' To calculate odds ratios, First, the sample size for level 1.1
#' is divided by the sample size for level 1.2. This value is divided
#' by the sample size for level 2.1, after dividing by the sample
#' size of level 2.2.
#'
#'      odds <- (n11 / n12) / (n21 / n22)
