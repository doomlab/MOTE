#' d for Dependent t with SD Difference Scores Denominator
#'
#' This function displays d and the non-central confidence interval
#' for repeated measures data, using the standard deviation
#' of the difference score as the denominator.
#'
#' To calculate d, the mean difference score is divided by
#' divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores.
#'
#'      d_z = mdiff / sddiff

#' #The following example is derived from the "dept_data" dataset included
#' #in the MOTE library.
#'
#' #In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on people's
#' #belief in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief
#' #in the supernatural before and after watching a popular science fiction movie.
#' #Higher scores indicated higher levels of belief. The mean difference score was 1.14,
#' #while the standard deviation of the difference scores was 2.12.
#'
#' #You can type in the numbers directly as shown below,
#' #or refer to your dataset within the function.

#'
#' #The mean measure of belief on the pretest was 5.57, with a standard
#' #deviation of 1.99. The posttest scores appeared lower (M = 4.43, SD = 2.88)
#' #but the dependent t-test was not significant using alpha = .05,
#' #t(7) = 1.43, p = .203, d_z = 0.54. The effect size was a medium
#' #effect suggesting that the movie may have influenced belief
#' #in the supernatural.
