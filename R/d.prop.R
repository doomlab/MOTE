#' d for Independent Proportions
#'
#' This function displays d and central confidence interval
#' calculated from differences in independent proportions.
#' Independent proportions are two percentages that are from
#' different groups of participants.
#'
#' To calculate z, the proportion of group two is substracted
#' from group one, which is then divided by the standard error.
#'
#'      z = (p1 - p2) / se
#'
#' To calculate d, the proportion of group two is divided by
#' the standard error of group two which is then subtracted
#' from the proportion of group one divided by the standard
#' error of group one.
#'
#'     z1 = p1 / se1
#'
#'     z2 = p2 / se2
#'
#'      d = z1 - z2

#' # Several researchers were examining the data on the number
#' # of students who retake a course after they receive a D, F,
#' # or withdraw from the course. They randomly sampled form
#' # a large university two groups of students: traditional
#' # (less than 25 years old) and non-traditional (25 and older).
#' # Each group included 100 participants. About 25% of students
#' # of the traditional group reported they would retake a course,
#' # while the non-traditional group showed about 35% would
#' # retake the course.
