#' V for Chi-Square
#'
#' This function displays V and non-central confidence interval
#' for the specified chi-square statistic.
#'
#' V is calculated by finding the square root of chi-squared divided by the product
#' of the sample size and the degrees of freedom with the lowest value.
#'
#'      v = sqrt(x2 / (n * dfsmall))

#' @param x2 chi-square statistic

#' # and their number of kids (1, 2, 3+) to determine if there was a
