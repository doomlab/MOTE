#' Epsilon for ANOVA from F and Sum of Squares
#'
#' This function displays epsilon squared from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
#' This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful
#' focus on the sum of squares total calculation.
#'
#' To calculate epsilon, first, the mean square for the error is
#' substracted from the mean square for the model. The difference
#' is multiplied by the degrees of freedom for the model. The
#' product is divided by the sum of squares total.
#'
#'      epsilon^2 = (dfm * (msm - mse)) / (sst)

#' # A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal
#' # attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor
#' # health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3

#' # and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group
#' # had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.
