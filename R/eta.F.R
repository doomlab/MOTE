#' \eqn{\eta^2} and Coefficient of Determination (R\eqn{^2}) for ANOVA from \eqn{F}
#'
#' This function displays \eqn{\eta^2} from ANOVA analyses
#' and their non-central confidence interval based on the \eqn{F} distribution.
#' These values are calculated directly from F statistics and can be used
#' for between subjects and repeated measures designs.
#' Remember if you have two or more IVs, these values are partial eta squared.
#'
#' Eta is calculated by multiplying the degrees of freedom of
#' the model by the F-statistic. This is divided by the product
#' of degrees of freedom of the model, the F-statistic, and
#' the degrees of freedom for the error or residual.
#'
#' \deqn{\eta^2 = \frac{df_m \cdot F}{df_m \cdot F + df_e}}

#' @param dfm degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between
#' @param dfe degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within
#' @param Fvalue F statistic
#' @param a significance level
#' @return Provides the effect size (\eqn{\eta^2}) with associated confidence intervals and relevant statistics.
