#' Chi-Square Test Example Data
#'
#' @description
#' Example data for a chi-square test of independence. Individuals were
#' polled and asked to report their number of friends (low, medium, high)
#' and their number of children (1, 2, 3 or more). The analysis examines
#' whether there is an association between friend group size and number of
#' children. It was hypothesized that those with more children may have
#' less time for friendship-maintaining activities.
