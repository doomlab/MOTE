#' d-g Corrected for Independent t
#'
#' This function displays d-g corrected
#' and the non-central confidence interval for independent t.
#'
#' The correction is calculated by dividing three by the sum of both
#' sample sizes after multiplying by four and subtracting nine.
#' This amount is deducted from one.
#'
#'      correction = 1 - (3 / (4 * (n1 + n2) - 9))
#'
#' D-g corrected is calculated by substracting mean two from mean one,
#' dividing by the pooled standard deviation which is multiplied
#' by the correction above.
#'
#'      d_g corrected = ((m1 - m2) / spooled) * correction

#' # dataset, included in the MOTE library.
#'
#' # A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#' # being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#' # can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#' # watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#' # each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#' # seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#' # were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#' # participants in the control group received the same
#' # questioning without hypnosis.
