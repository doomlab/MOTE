#' $\omega^2_G$ (Generalized Omega Squared) for Multi-Way and Mixed ANOVA from $F$
#'
#' This function displays $\omega^2_G$ (generalized omega squared) from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the $F$ distribution.
#' This formula is appropriate for multi-way repeated-measures
#' designs and mixed-level designs.
#'
#' Omega squared is calculated by subtracting the product of the
#' degrees of freedom of the model and the mean square of the
#' subject variance from the sum of squares for the model.
#'
#' This is divided by the value obtained after combining
#' the sum of squares total, sum of squares for the other
#' independent variable, and the mean square of the
#' subject variance multiplied by the number of levels
#' in the other model/IV/between.
#'
#'     $$\omega^2_G = \frac{SS_M - (df_m \times MS_S)}{SS_T + SS_{M2} + j \times MS_S}$$

#' # The following example is derived from the "mix2_data"

#'
#' # Given previous research, we know that backward strength in free
#' # association tends to increase the ratings participants give when
#' # you ask them how many people out of 100 would say a word in
#' # response to a target word (like Family Feud). This result is
#' # tied to peopleâ€™s overestimation of how well they think they know
#' # something, which is bad for studying. So, we gave people instructions
#' # on how to ignore the BSG.  Did it help? Is there an interaction
#' # between BSG and instructions given?
