#' $\omega^2_p$ (Partial Omega Squared) for Between-Subjects ANOVA from $F$
#'
#' This function displays $\omega^2_p$ from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the $F$ distribution.
#' This formula is appropriate for multi-way between-subjects designs.
#'
#' Partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting the mean square for the error
#' from the mean square of the model, which is multiplied by degrees of freedom of
#' the model. This is divided by the product of the degrees of freedom
#' for the model are deducted from the sample size, multiplied by the
#' mean square of the error, plus the sum of squares for the model.
#'
#'     $$\omega^2_p = \frac{df_m (MS_M - MS_E)}{SS_M + (n - df_m) \times MS_E}$$
