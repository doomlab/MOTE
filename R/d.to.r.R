#' r and Coefficient of Determination (R2) from d
#'
#' Calculates r from d and then translates r to r2 to calculate
#' the non-central confidence interval for r2 using the F distribution.
#'
#' The correlation coefficient (r) is calculated by dividing Cohen's d
#' by the square root of the total sample size squared - divided
#' by the product of the sample sizes of group one and group two.
#'
#'      r = d / sqrt(d^2 + (n1 + n2)^2 / (n1*n2))

#' @param d effect size statistic
#' @param n1 sample size group one
#' @param n2 sample size group two
#' @param a significance level
#' @return Provides the effect size (correlation coefficient) with associated
#' confidence intervals, the t-statistic, F-statistic, and other estimates
#' appropriate for d to r translation. Note this CI is not based on the
#' traditional r-to-z transformation but rather non-central F using the
#' ci.R function from MBESS.

#' # The following example is derived from the "indt_data"
#' # dataset, included in the MOTE library.
#'
#' # A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#' # being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#' # can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#' # watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#' # each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#' # seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#' # were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#' # participants in the control group received the same
#' # questioning without hypnosis.
