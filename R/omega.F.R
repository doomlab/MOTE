#' $\omega^2$ for ANOVA from $F$
#'
#' This function displays $\omega^2$ from ANOVA analyses
#' and its non-central confidence interval based on the $F$ distribution.
#' These values are calculated directly from F statistics and can be used
#' for between subjects and repeated measures designs.
#' Remember if you have two or more IVs, these values are partial omega squared.
#'
#' Omega squared or partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting one
#' from the F-statistic and multiplying it by degrees of freedom of the model. This is
#' divided by the same value after adding the number of valid responses. This
#' value will be omega squared for one-way ANOVA designs, and will be
#' partial omega squared for multi-way ANOVA designs (i.e. with more than one IV).
#'
#'     $$\omega^2 = \frac{df_m (F - 1)}{df_m (F - 1) + n}$$
