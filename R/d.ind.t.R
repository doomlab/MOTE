#' d for Between Subjects with Pooled SD Denominator
#'
#' This function displays d for between subjects data
#' and the non-central confidence interval using the
#' pooled standard deviation as the denominator.
#'
#' To calculate d, mean two is subtracted from mean one and divided
#' by the pooled standard deviation.
#'
#'      d_s = (m1 - m2) / spooled

#' @return Provides the effect size (Cohen's d) with associated confidence intervals,

#' #The following example is derived from the "indt_data" dataset, included
#' #in the MOTE library.
#'
#' #A forensic psychologist conducted a study to examine whether
#' #being hypnotized during recall affects how well a witness
#' #can remember facts about an event. Eight participants
#' #watched a short film of a mock robbery, after which
#' #each participant was questioned about what he or she had
#' #seen. The four participants in the experimental group
#' #were questioned while they were hypnotized. The four
#' #participants in the control group recieved the same
#' #questioning without hypnosis.
